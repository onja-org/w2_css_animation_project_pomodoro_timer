# 🍅 CSS Animation Project: Pomodoro Timer

## What You're Building

You're going to create a **functional Pomodoro timer** - a real tool you might actually use while coding! This is a hands-on project where you'll build a beautiful, animated interface using HTML, CSS, and pre-written JavaScript.

## What You'll Learn

- **HTML-CSS-JavaScript Integration**: How to connect HTML elements to JavaScript functionality using IDs
- **CSS Animations & Transitions**: Creating smooth, professional interactions and state changes
- **State Management**: Visual representation of different application states (work mode, break mode, paused)
- **Responsive Design**: Making interfaces that work across all devices
- **Performance Optimization**: Creating smooth 60fps animations
- **Accessibility**: Building inclusive user experiences
