    Build your timer interface here!

    Remember: Your HTML must include these IDs for the JavaScript to work:
    - timer-container (main container)
    - time-display (shows the time)
    - start-work-button (starts 25-minute work session)
    - start-break-button (starts 5-minute break)
    - pause-button (pauses/resumes)
    - reset-button (resets everything)

    The timer-container will automatically get these classes:
    - work-mode (during work)
    - break-mode (during break)
    - paused (when paused)
    - completed (briefly, when timer finishes)

    You can add any other elements, structure, and content you want!
